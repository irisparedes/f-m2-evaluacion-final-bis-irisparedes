Final evaluation 2bis. Iris Paredes.
The game of couples.
This game, although still without implementing the operation ... Try to find the letter that is a couple that we raise.
application that consists of two parts:
-A form to choose the size of the game and a button.
- A list of letters, each item of the list has 2 images that represent both
sides of a letter (when one is visible the other is hidden).

By clicking on the 'Start' button, our application must collect the size of the game size (4, 6 or 8 cards) and connect to an API that returns a list of cards with Pokemon images.
By clicking on a letter we will show its front and hide its back. When we click again we will do the opposite operation, and we will see its back part and hide the front.
